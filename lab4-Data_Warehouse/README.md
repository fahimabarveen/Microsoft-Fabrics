Power BI data modeling presentation using **Ralph Kimball’s** star schema methodology, especially focusing on student data. 

**Introduction**
Title: Introduction to Data Modeling
Content: Briefly introduce Ralph Kimball and the star schema model. Highlight its importance in data warehousing for simplicity, performance, and ease of understanding.

**Understanding Star Schema**
Title: What is a Star Schema?
Content: Explain the star schema structure with a central fact table connected to dimension tables. Use a simple diagram to illustrate this.

**Components of Star Schema**
Title: Components of Star Schema
Content: Describe the fact table and dimension tables.
Fact Table: Contains quantitative data for analysis (e.g., student grades, attendance).
Dimension Tables: Contain descriptive attributes related to the fact data (e.g., student details, course information).

**Example Data Model**
Title: Example Student Data Model
Content: Present a sample star schema for student data.
Fact Table: Student Performance (columns: StudentID, CourseID, Grade, Attendance)
Dimension Tables:
Students (columns: StudentID, Name, Age, Gender)
Courses (columns: CourseID, CourseName, Instructor)
Time (columns: Date, Semester, Year)

**Building the Model in Power BI**
Title: Building the Model in Power BI
Content: Step-by-step guide on how to create the star schema in Power BI.
