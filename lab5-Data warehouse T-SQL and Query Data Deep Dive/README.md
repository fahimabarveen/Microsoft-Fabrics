----------------------------Load Data via Pipeline----->Warehouse SQL Queries------------------------

Here’s a simplified version of your storyline and architecture diagram for loading CSV sales data into a Lakehouse for analysis by a supermarket’s marketing department:

Goal: Analyze Sales Data for Insights
The supermarket’s marketing department aims to:

1.Understand sales trends across various categories (e.g., Beverages, Snacks, Eggs).
2.Identify top-selling items and customers in each region.
3.Determine monthly and yearly sales patterns to optimize marketing strategies.
4.Evaluate customer preferences by city and region.
5.Measure the impact of discounts on overall profits and losses.

Solution
1.Load Data:Collect daily sales data in CSV files.

Load these CSV files into Microsoft Fabric’s Lakehouse using pipelines.
Transform the data into warehouse tables.

2.Warehouse Schema:Create fact tables (e.g., fact_sales) to store sales data.

Create dimension tables (e.g., dim_customer, dim_product, dim_region) to store related information.

3.Stored Procedures:Develop stored procedures to load data from CSV files into the warehouse tables.
Use parameters such as year and city for data loading.

4.Power BI Reports:Use Power BI to generate visual reports.

Analyze total sales, top customers, and high-performing products.
