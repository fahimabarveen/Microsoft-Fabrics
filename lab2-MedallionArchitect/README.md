### **Medallion Architecture Overview**

The Medallion Architecture organizes data into three stages or "layers," each serving a different purpose in data processing and analysis. Think of these layers as a process of refinement:

1. **Bronze Layer (Raw Data)**:
   - **Purpose**: Store raw, unprocessed data as it comes in from various sources.
   - **Example**: Logs, transactional data, or any data dumped from external systems.

2. **Silver Layer (Cleaned and Enriched Data)**:
   - **Purpose**: Clean, transform, and enrich the raw data. This layer might involve data cleansing, normalization, and integration with other datasets.
   - **Example**: Structured data tables with cleaned records, enriched with additional data like geographical info or customer segments.

3. **Gold Layer (Curated and Optimized Data)**:
   - **Purpose**: Prepare data for high-level analysis and reporting. This layer usually involves aggregation, summarization, and optimization for specific queries or business use cases.
   - **Example**: Aggregated sales reports, KPIs dashboards, or pre-calculated metrics for business intelligence.

### **How It Works**

1. **Data Ingestion**: Raw data flows into the **Bronze Layer**.
2. **Transformation**: Data is then processed and refined in the **Silver Layer**.
3. **Aggregation & Optimization**: Finally, data is aggregated and optimized for reporting in the **Gold Layer**.

This architecture allows you to manage and transform data in a structured way, making it easier to access and analyze for different business needs.
